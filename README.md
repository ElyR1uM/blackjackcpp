# Blackjack written in C++

Terminal based blackjack game in C++ using ncurses.
This project is a sandbox for me to practice
C++ and improve my coding in general, so expect
some coding atrocities. The best way to avoid
mistakes is to learn from them.

## Building:

Download or clone the code, cd into the directory and:
```bash
$ make
$ ./blackjack
```
